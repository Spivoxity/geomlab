==Options menu==

;Match brackets: If this option is enabled, then each closing bracket  (either ')' or&nbsp;']') that is typed in the bottom pane highlights all the text back to the matching opening bracket with a blue line. If the brackets do not match properly, or there are more closing than opening brackets, then the line appears in red instead.  This option makes it easier to type complicated expressions, especially ones that end with a lot of closing brackets. 
;Larger font: This command increases the size of the text in the two panes of the main GeomLab window. 
;Smaller font: This command decreases the size of the text.
;Count reduction steps: If this option is enabled, then GeomLab counts the number of 'reduction steps' that are needed to evaluate each expression, and the number of 'conses' used to build data structures, and displays the totals together with the value of the expression in the Results pane.
