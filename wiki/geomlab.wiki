This web site will introduce you to some of the most important
ideas in computer programming in an interactive, visual way through a
guided activity. The activity is about a language for describing
pictures. You will use a programming environment that lets you type an
expression in the language, and shows you the picture that it
describes. 

At first, the pictures you will make will be simple
combinations of stick figures: three men in a row, or one man
supporting two smaller men. But gradually, the pictures will get more
complicated, and soon we will be describing pictures like the one shown at the right.  That picture looks frighteningly complicated, but like all the pictures we will describe, it consists of a few basic tiles combined according to some fixed rules.

Although the picture at the right is complicated, it clearly has some kind of structure, and we will describe the structure in the form of a computer program that can generate it.
