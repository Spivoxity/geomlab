How do you write a computer program?

\item {\it Expressing thoughts as formulas}
\item {\it Building complex objects from simple parts}
\item {\it Dealing with misteaks}

\slide{Expressing thoughts as formulas}

Everything a computer does must be written down in a highly
constrained ``language''

\item {\it It's more difficult than drawing a picture}
\item {\it But immense power comes from writing instructions
that are general}

\slide{Complex objects, simple parts}

The building blocks for computer programs are few in kind, but
they can be combined in many ways

\item Millions of different programs can be built from a fixed
number of components
\item Understanding how the components work is enough to understand
any system built from them

\slide{Dealing with mistakes}

Computers are ruthlessly precise machines; humans less so

\item {\it In computer programming, mistakes are inevitable}
\item {\it We try to correct all the mistakes before we say
that a program is finished}
